A collection of projects I'm making with AI tools while exploring their capabilities

 AI Tool Investigation
==

This is a summary of my findings as I play with AI Tools.
There are two motivations for this:
- I think there is great promise in having code generation from language models. I would like to work on a tool that maximizes the utility of these models while keeping the programmer in the loop.
- I want to know the progress and limitations of the current state of these tools.


Tools will be centered on the following usecases:
- Creating a project from scratch 
- Adding a full feature to an existing project

Here are the steps:
- All features will be written in one file .
- The features will then be refactored to be more modular, reproducible and readable.

First step will be done using Tab/Typing.
Second Step will be done using an agent.


## Creating a project from scratch:
### A Complex Calculator

A scientific calculator that runs in the terminal

### Tools
- [ ] Windsurf
- [ ] Cursor
- [ ] Codex
- [ ] Firebase Studio
- [ ] Kiro
- [ ] Visual studio code****


Results, thoughts and findings will be found in their respective directories.
